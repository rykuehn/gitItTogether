## Usage

> clone the repo

> npm install

> npm run dev

> Checkout the site at localhost:8100

> To Test: npm test

## Approach

My general approach was to get the basic funcationality to work: api call, proper routing, onClick functionality. Then I cleaned up my code and made the React Components more concise and straightforward. Lastly, I added some styling and wrote tests.

## Achievements

I found a clever way using local storage to allow for my data to persist when the pages are refreshed. Also, I configured React-Router to reflect different query parameters in the URL. Overall, I had a fun time starting from scratch with webpack, building components, and continually refactoring. As with most projects, there are always more things to do and optimize and I've listed a few of my ideas below. 

## Future

Things that I would like to continue working on:
1. Add more tests + continuous integration
2. Further develop the design concepts
3. Server-side rendering
4. Make a Docker Image
